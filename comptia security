1. The organization that Chris works for has disabled automatic updates. What is the most common reason for disabling automatic updates for organizational systems?
* A. To avoid disruption of the work process for office workers
* B. To prevent security breaches due to malicious patches and updates
* C. To avoid issues with problematic patches and updates
* D. All of the above

> **Explanation:** Organizations often disable automatic updates to test them first in a controlled environment. This ensures that a new patch won't cause system instability or software conflicts before it is rolled out to the entire company.

2. Which of the following is the least volatile according to the forensic order of volatility?
* A. The system's routing table
* B. Logs
* C. Temp files
* D. CPU registers


> **Explanation:** In digital forensics, the order of volatility ranks how long data remains available. Data in CPU registers and RAM (like routing tables) is highly volatile and lost when power is cut. Logs are stored on non-volatile media (the hard drive) and are more persistent than temporary system files.

3. Ed wants to trick a user into connecting to his evil twin access point (AP). What type of attack should he conduct to increase his chances of the user connecting to it?
* A. A disassociation attack
* B. An application denial-of-service attack
* C. A known plain-text attack
* D. A network denial-of-service attack

> **Explanation:** A Wireless disassociation attack kicks a user off their legitimate network. When the user's device attempts to reconnect, it will often automatically connect to the attacker's "Evil Twin" if it has the same name and a stronger signal.

*4. What term is used to describe wireless site surveys that show the relative power of access points on a diagram of the building or facility?
* A. Signal surveys
* B. db maps
* C. AP topologies
* D. Heatmaps

> **Explanation:** Heatmaps are visual representations of wireless signal strength. They use color-coding (typically red for strong and blue for weak) overlaid on a floor plan to show coverage and dead zones.

5. What hardware device is used to create the hardware root of trust for modern desktops and laptops?
* A. System memory
* B. A HSM
* C. The CPU
* D. The TPM

> **Explanation:** A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a specialized chip on a local device that provides hardware-based security functions, such as generating and storing cryptographic keys, which forms the "root of trust."

6. Angela wants to prevent users in her organization from changing their passwords repeatedly after they have been changed so that they cannot reuse their current password. What two password security settings does she need to implement to make this occur?
* A. Set a password history and a minimum password age.
* B. Set a password history and a complexity setting.
* C. Set a password minimum and maximum age.
* D. Set password complexity and maximum age.

> **Explanation:** Password history remembers old passwords to prevent immediate reuse. However, a "minimum password age" is required to prevent users from rapidly changing their password multiple times in one day just to cycle through the history and get back to their original one.

1️⃣ Password History:
Remembers a set number of previously used passwords.Prevents users from reusing those passwords.
Example:
If password history is set to 5, the user cannot reuse any of their last 5 passwords.

2️⃣ Minimum Password Age
Requires a password to be kept for a certain amount of time before it can be changed again.
Example:
If the minimum password age is 1 day, the user must wait 24 hours before changing it again.

7. Chris wants to establish a backup site that is fully ready to take over for full operations for his organization at any time. What type of site should he set up?
* A. A cold site
* B. A clone site
* C. A hot site
* D. A ready site

> **Explanation:** A hot site is a fully functional backup facility that has all the necessary hardware, software, and up-to-date data mirrored from the main site, allowing for near-instant failover.

A. Cold site → Facility only; no active systems or data. Slowest recovery.
B. Clone site → Exact copy of production, usually updated periodically (not always real-time).
C. Hot site → Fully operational with real-time data replication; fastest recovery.
D. Ready site (Warm site) → Partially configured systems; moderate recovery time.
